description: "Indonesia has been exporting coffee since 1711, when the Dutch
  East India Company sent its first shipment from Java to Europe. The crop was
  profitable for many exporters and importers: less so for the country’s
  producers. In 1960, the novel ‘Max Havelaar: Or the Coffee Auctions of the
  Dutch Trading Company’ was published, outlining the abuses endorsed by the
  Colonial Dutch system. The novel transformed the labour system and even
  provided inspiration for the first Fair Trade label – Max Havelaar.  "

<p>Indonesia’s production was originally nearly 100% Arabica until, in the 1870s, coffee leaf rust decimated production. Farmers slowly replaced Arabica with Robusta, and today, although Indonesia is a significant coffee producing country – the fourth biggest in the world behind Brazil, Colombia and Vietnam – only around 25% of production is Arabica.

Many coffees from Indonesia are today processed using the fully washed method. However, traditionally the post harvest process of ‘**Giling Basah**’ (‘wet hulling’) is used. Growers hand-pulp their coffee at their farm, briefly dry it, and then offer it for sale at the local village market or deliver it very wet (around 30-50 percent humidity) to a collection station nearby. Unlike in most countries, where the coffee remains in parchment until it is milled just before export, the coffee is then hulled and re-dried until it is dry enough to store without rotting. The result is a unique cup profile that many people find delicious.

The mills have a network of local representatives in the growing areas that buy partially dried parchment, fully dried parchment, and part and fully dried green to varying degrees of preparation. Uniquely, Indonesia has developed hulling machinery to mill even 18% wet parchment – a very likely cause of the unique blue/green colour that can be found in some lots. It is also the likely cause of the huge quality variance between the best and worst lots - not least because some coffee will be fermented if the hulling process is too slow.

Indeed, Indonesia has a great deal to offer the specialty market, with distinct and unique profiles depending on region and processing. Most notably, Mercanta offers specialty coffees from Sumatra & Java; however, the country’s other islands of Sulawesi, Flores and Bali also produce coffee.</p>
